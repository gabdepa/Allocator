# Allocator
This repositorie holds the project for the matter [*Software BÃ¡sico of the UFPR*](https://www.inf.ufpr.br/bmuller/#/ci1064)\
The main goal of the project was to implement our own Memory Allocator(*malloc()*), that allocates memory dinamically, below is the description of the folders and the project.\
There are 3 folders in this repositorie:\

* "trashx"
    * Holds the original code asked on the project, which implements BestFit, NextFit, FirstFit and an ordinary Allocator of memory, all of them use Heap

* "Original"
    * The first modification, which was made to presentation on the first part, here we use the NextFit algorithm

* "Alterado"
    * The last modification, which was made in order to better deallocate memory, here we use the FirstFit algorithm
